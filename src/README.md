The purpose of this Readme file is to explain/add definitions to the codes used for implementing the program.

**let** - allows the variable to be assigned to a specific numeric variable/integer/character or operation. One such example of the let operation is seen in the code through this commands:

**function** - creates a new function which uses the variables which are included within its parentheses. Its implementation is also seen in the screenshot above.

**Return** - Returns the value of the variables after operation or after input. Its implementation is seen when text is printed alongside the new value which is seen later in a new screenshot.

**const [variable name] = parse[variableType](prompt("Text"));** - Assigns a variable as a specific variable type and also asks the user for user input. An example of this code is

**if/else** -- allows the program to know whether to display or not to display certain errors in this case it is used alongside !isNaN which indicates that the program should not run if the input of width and height are not integers. 

**console.log/warning/info** -- Is used to display text or printouts in the console of a browser. Useful for debugging or indicating errors in a website. In this case it is used to display the return outputs of the variables.
